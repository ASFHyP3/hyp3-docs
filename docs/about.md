# HyP3: ASF's On Demand Processing Platform

The Alaska Satellite Facility's Hybrid Pluggable Processing Pipeline, or HyP3 (pronounced *"hype"*), is a cloud-native 
processing platform developed to efficiently process Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. 

Through HyP3, ASF offers a family of cloud-native, scalable product generation services that 
make its data holdings more accessible. HyP3 primarily runs compute-heavy workflows, which take tens of minutes to 
hours of compute time, to create products that are easier to use, GIS-ready, and customized to a userâ€™s needs.

## How it Works

HyP3 was designed to address many common issues for users of SAR data:

* Most SAR datasets require at least some processing to remove distortions before they are analysis-ready
* SAR processing is computing-intensive
* Software for SAR processing is complicated to use and/or prohibitively expensive
* Producing analysis-ready SAR data has a steep learning curve that acts as a barrier to entry

HyP3 solves these problems by providing an interface where users can request SAR processing on demand. These
processing requests are picked up by automated systems, which handle the complexity of SAR processing on behalf of the
user. Refer to our [Architecture](how_it_works.md "Jump to Architecture Documentation") page to learn more about the 
structure of the HyP3 platform.

HyP3 doesn't require users to have a lot of knowledge of SAR processing before getting started; they only need to
submit the input data and set a few optional parameters if desired. With HyP3, analysis-ready products are just a few
clicks away.

    For users who need more processing than the 10,000 credit limit allows, ASF now hosts 
    [HyP3+](about/hyp3_plus.md "Jump to the HyP3+ Landing Page"), a user-supported 
    version of HyP3 that allows you to purchase as many credits as you need.
