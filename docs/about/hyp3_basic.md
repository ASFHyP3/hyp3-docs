# HyP3 Basic

ASF released HyP3 to the public back in 2020. This service, now called HyP3 Basic, is funded by NASA, and hosted in 
NASA's Earthdata Cloud (EDC). Output products are hosted in an S3 bucket in EDC, and are retained for 14 days before 
being deleted. 

Anyone can use HyP3 Basic. All you need are Earthdata Login credentials. 

Each user receives 10,000 credits each month to use for processing any On Demand products. If you need to process 
more data than is possible with this credit allotment, you can purchase additional credits using 
[HyP3+](hyp3_plus.md "Jump to HyP3+ Documentation").
