# Sentinel-1 Burst InSAR Product Guide

This document is a guide for users of Sentinel-1 Burst Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) products generated by the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF).

InSAR jobs can be processed on the basis of individual [radar bursts](#sentinel-1-bursts "Jump to the Sentinel-1 Bursts section of this document") that comprise the Sentinel-1 SLC products, and users can select up to fifteen contiguous along-path bursts to merge together into a single interferogram.

## Burst InSAR Job Types

There are currently two different [burst-based](#sentinel-1-bursts "Jump to the Sentinel-1 Bursts section of this document") InSAR jobs available. 

### Single-Burst InSAR
The original burst-based InSAR job type, `INSAR_ISCE_BURST`, only accepts a single pair of SLC bursts. This job type is supported in [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/ "https://search.asf.alaska.edu" ){target=_blank} as well as the [HyP3 API](../using/api.md ){target=_blank} and [Python SDK](../using/sdk.md ){target=_blank}.

!!! tip "Deprecation of the INSAR_ISCE_BURST job type"

    The original `INSAR_ISCE_BURST` job type will be deprecated once support for `INSAR_ISCE_MULTI_BURST` jobs is available in [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/ "https://search.asf.alaska.edu" ){target=_blank}. For now, only single-burst interferograms are available through the [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/ "https://search.asf.alaska.edu" ){target=_blank} interface, but support for multi-burst interferograms is coming soon!

### Multi-Burst InSAR
The `INSAR_ISCE_MULTI_BURST` job type accepts lists of SLC bursts, and mosaics them together before generating the interferogram. This job type is not yet supported in Vertex, but can be submitted using the [HyP3 API](../using/api.md ){target=_blank} and [Python SDK](../using/sdk.md ){target=_blank}. 

This job type supports pairings of 1 to 15 contiguous along-track bursts. The number of bursts processed impacts the number of credits consumed. Refer to the [Credit Cost Table](../using/credits.md#credit-cost-table "Credit Cost Table" ){target=_blank} for more details.

## Sentinel-1 Bursts

[Single Look Complex](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-1-sar/products-algorithms/level-1-algorithms/single-look-complex 'https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-1-sar/products-algorithms/level-1-algorithms/single-look-complex' ){target=_blank} (SLC) data is required to generate interferograms from Sentinel-1 data. The European Space Agency (ESA) packages this type of data into Interferometric Wide (IW) SLC products, which are available for download from ASF. These IW SLC products include three sub-swaths, each containing many individual burst SLCs.

Historically, most InSAR processing has been performed using the full IW SLC scene, but ASF has developed a method of [extracting the individual SLC bursts](https://sentinel1-burst-documentation.asf.alaska.edu/ 'https://sentinel1-burst-documentation.asf.alaska.edu/' ){target=_blank} from IW SLC products, which facilitates burst-based processing workflows.

Refer to the [Sentinel-1 Bursts tutorial](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/88c8fe67933340779eddef212d76b8b8 "Sentinel-1 Bursts Tutorial https://arcg.is/zSafi0" ){target=_blank} to learn more about how [ASF extracts burst-level products](https://sentinel1-burst-documentation.asf.alaska.edu/ "ASF Sentinel-1 Burst Documentation" ){target=_blank} from Sentinel-1 IW and EW SLCs.

### Benefits of Bursts

Working at the burst level of the Sentinel-1 SLC data provides some key benefits:

**1. Bursts are consistently geolocated through time.**
The coverage of a burst is the same for every orbit of the satellite, so you can be confident that every burst with the same [Full Burst ID](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/88c8fe67933340779eddef212d76b8b8#ref-n-VYIiUe "Sentinel-1 Burst Overview https://arcg.is/zSafi0" ){target=_blank} in a stack of acquisitions will cover the same geographic location. In contrast, the framing of the IW SLCs is not consistent through time, so when using IW SLCs as the basis for InSAR, scene pairs do not always fully overlap.

**2. Bursts cover a smaller geographic area.**
IW SLC products are extremely large. In many cases, only a small portion of the IW footprint is of interest. Burst-based processing allows you to process only the bursts that cover your specific area of interest, which significantly decreases the time and cost required to generate and analyze InSAR products.

**3. Bursts provide AOI customization.**
When using the `INSAR_ISCE_MULTI_BURST` job type, you can select multiple reference and secondary bursts from the same track. This allows you to compose a custom area of interest (AOI) and create an InSAR product that spans IW SLC boundaries. We currently support InSAR jobs that include up to 15 contiguous burst footprints.

### Burst InSAR Processing

The Sentinel-1 Burst InSAR products are generated using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's [ISCE2 software](https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2#readme "https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2" ){target=_blank}. ASF is committed to transparency in product development, and we are pleased to be able to offer an InSAR product that leverages open-source software for processing.

For those who would prefer to work at the scale of a full IW SLC, our original [On Demand InSAR](insar_product_guide.md){target=_blank} products are still available. These products have a larger footprint, and are generated using [GAMMA software](https://www.gamma-rs.ch/software){target=_blank}.

### Using Sentinel-1 Burst InSAR

Users can request Sentinel-1 Burst InSAR products [On Demand](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/?topic=onDemand "https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/?topic=onDemand" ){target=_blank} in ASF's [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/ "https://search.asf.alaska.edu" ){target=_blank} data portal, or make use of our HyP3 [Python SDK](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/using/sdk/ "https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/using/sdk" ){target=_blank} or [API](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/using/api/ "https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/using/api" ){target=_blank}. Input pair selection in Vertex uses either the [Baseline Tool](https://docs.asf.alaska.edu/vertex/baseline/ "https://docs.asf.alaska.edu/vertex/baseline/" ){target=_blank} or the [SBAS Tool](https://docs.asf.alaska.edu/vertex/sbas/ "https://docs.asf.alaska.edu/vertex/sbas" ){target=_blank} search interfaces.

!!! warning "Only single-pair Burst InSAR processing is currently supported in Vertex"

    We are transitioning from the `INSAR_ISCE_BURST` to the `INSAR_ISCE_MULTI_BURST` 
    HyP3 job type to support multi-burst AOIs.

    `INSAR_ISCE_MULTI_BURST` job support is currently only available via our API and
    Python SDK, so [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/ "https://search.asf.alaska.edu" ){target=_blank} users will not be able to submit multi-burst jobs for 
    processing. 

    Burst InSAR jobs submitted in Vertex are currently limited to single-burst pairs, 
    but we plan to add Vertex support for `INSAR_ISCE_MULTI_BURST` jobs in the coming months.

On Demand InSAR products only include co-polarized interferograms (VV or HH). Cross-polarized interferograms (VH or HV) are not available using this service.

Users are cautioned to read the sections on [limitations](#limitations "Jump to the Limitations section of this document") and [error sources](#error-sources "Jump to the Error Sources section of this document") in InSAR products before attempting to use InSAR data. For a more complete description of the properties of SAR, see our [Introduction to SAR](../guides/introduction_to_sar.md "https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/guides/introduction_to_sar" ){target=_blank} guide.

{% block processing_options %}
### Processing Options

There are several options users can set when ordering Burst InSAR On Demand products:

1. The **number of looks** drives the resolution and pixel spacing of the output products:

    | Looks | Resolution | Pixel Spacing |
    |-------|------------|---------------|
    | 20x4  | 160 m      | 80 m          |
    | 10x2  | 80 m       | 40 m          |
    | 5x1   | 40 m       | 20 m          |

    Products generated with 10x2 looks have a file size roughly 4 times that of 20x4-look products.
    Similarly, 5x1-look products have a file size roughly 4 times that of 10x2-look products
    (or 16 times that of 20x4-look products).

    The default is 20x4 looks.

2. There is an option to apply a **water mask**. This mask includes coastal waters and most inland waterbodies. Masking waterbodies can have a significant impact during phase unwrapping, as water can sometimes exhibit enough coherence between acquisitions to allow for unwrapping to occur over waterbodies, which is invalid. 

    A GeoTIFF of the water mask is always included with the InSAR product package, but when this option is selected, the conditional water mask will be applied before the phase unwrapping process. Water masking is turned off by default. Visit our [InSAR Water Masking Tutorial](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/485916be1b1d46889aa436794b5633cb "InSAR Water Masking StoryMap" ){target=_blank} for more information.

{% block workflow %}
## Burst InSAR Workflow

The Burst InSAR workflow used in HyP3 was developed by ASF using ISCE2 software. The steps include pre-processing, interferogram preparation, and product creation. Once these steps are performed, an output product package is created. See [product packaging](#product-packaging "Jump to Product Packaging section of this document") for details on the individual files included in the package.

### Pre-Processing

Pre-processing steps prepare the SAR images to be used in interferometry.
The pre-processing steps include downloading the burst SLC data and repacking it in the SAFE format,
downloading the DEM file,
and downloading the orbit and auxiliary data files.

#### Download Burst Data

The Burst InSAR workflow accepts as input a reference and secondary set of
[Interferometric Wide swath Single Look Complex](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/acquisition-modes/interferometric-wide-swath "https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/acquisition-modes/interferometric-wide-swath" ){target=_blank}
(IW SLC) burst granules. Internally, each set of bursts must be collected within the same orbit, share a single polarization, and be contiguous within a single Sentinel-1 track. The reference and secondary sets must contain the same burst ID/polarization combinations. 

The bursts are downloaded using ASF's
[Sentinel-1 Burst Extractor](https://sentinel1-burst-documentation.asf.alaska.edu/ "https://sentinel1-burst-documentation.asf.alaska.edu/" ){target=_blank}, and are then repackaged into reference and secondary [ESA SAFE](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/safe-format "SAFE Format" ){target=_blank} files using the [`burst2safe`](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/burst2safe "burst2safe Python package" ){target=_blank} package. Repackaging the burst SLC data into two ESA SAFE files allows the reference and secondary collections of bursts to be processed with ISCE2 as if they were a pair of full IW SLC files from ESA.

#### Download the DEM File

In order to create differential InSAR products that show motion on the ground,
one must subtract the topographic phase from the interferogram.
The topographic phase, in this case, is replicated by using an
[existing DEM](../dems.md "HyP3 DEM Documentation" ){target=_blank}
to calculate the actual topographic phase.
This phase is then removed from the interferogram leaving just the motion or deformation signal
(plus atmospheric delays and noise).

The DEM that is used for HyP3 InSAR processing is the
[2022 Release of the Copernicus GLO-30 Public DEM](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/copernicus-contributing-missions/collections-description/COP-DEM "Copernicus DEM" ){target=_blank}
dataset
[publicly available on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/copernicus-dem/ "https://registry.opendata.aws/copernicus-dem" ){target=_blank},
which provides global coverage at 30-m pixel spacing (except for an area over Armenia and Azerbaijan, which only has 90-m coverage).

The portion of the DEM that covers the input bursts is downloaded.

#### Download Orbit Files and Calibration Auxiliary Data Files

For Sentinel-1 InSAR processing, ISCE2 requires additional satellite orbit and calibration metadata files. The orbit files are downloaded from the
[Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Data/Sentinel1.html#sentinel-1-precise-orbit-determination-pod-products "Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem" ){target=_blank}. The calibration auxiliary data files are downloaded from the
[Sentinel-1 Mission Performance Center](https://sar-mpc.eu/ "Sentinel-1 Mission Performance Center" ){target=_blank}.

### InSAR Processing

The ISCE2 InSAR processing this product uses follows the workflow in [topsApp.py](https://github.com/isce-framework/isce2/blob/main/applications/topsApp.py#L982){target=_blank} from steps `startup` through `geocode`. These steps perform the following processing:

1. Extract the orbits, Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) version, burst data, and antenna pattern if it is necessary.
1. Calculate the perpendicular and parallel baselines.
1. Map the DEM into the radar coordinates of the reference image. This generates the longitude, latitude, height and LOS angles on a pixel by pixel grid for each burst.
1. Estimate the azimuth offsets between the input SLC bursts. The Enhanced Spectral Diversity (ESD) method is *not* used.
1. Estimate the range offsets between the input SLC bursts.
1. Co-register the secondary SLC burst by applying the estimated range and azimuth offsets.
1. Produce the wrapped phase interferogram.
1. Apply the [Goldstein-Werner](https://doi.org/10.1029/1998GL900033){target=_blank} power spectral filter with a dampening factor of 0.5.
1. Optionally apply a water mask to the data.
1. Unwrap the wrapped phase interferogram using [SNAPHU](http://web.stanford.edu/group/radar/softwareandlinks/sw/snaphu/){target=_blank}'s minimum cost flow (MCF) unwrapping algorithm to produce the unwrapped phase interferogram.
1. Geocode the output products.

#### Apply Water Mask
There is an option to apply a **water mask**. This mask includes coastal waters and most inland waterbodies. Masking waterbodies can have a significant impact during phase unwrapping, as water can sometimes exhibit enough coherence between acquisitions to allow for unwrapping to occur over waterbodies, which is invalid.

A GeoTIFF of the water mask is always included with the InSAR product package, but when this option is selected, the conditional water mask will be applied along with coherence and intensity thresholds during the phase unwrapping process. Water masking is turned off by default.

The water mask is generated by ASF using data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about){target=_blank} and/or [ESA WorldCover](https://esa-worldcover.org/en/about/about){target=_blank} depending on location. Areas within Canada, Alaska, and Russia are primarily covered by ESA WorldCover data, while the rest of the world is covered by OpenStreetMap data. Refer to the [Water Masking](../water_masking.md "Water Masking Documentation" ){target=_blank} documentation page for more details.

This water mask is available for all longitudes, but data is only available from -85 to 85 degrees latitude. All areas between 85 and 90 degrees north latitude are treated as water, and all areas between 85 and 90 degrees south latitude are treated as land for the purposes of the water mask.

Water masks were previously generated from the [Global Self-consistent,
Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database (GSHHG)](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gshhg "http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gshhg" ){target=_blank} dataset, but we transitioned to using the OpenStreetMap/ESA WorldCover datasets in February 2024 to improve performance. In addition to being a more recent and accurate dataset, this also allows us to mask most inland waterbodies. When using the GSHHG dataset, we only masked large inland waterbodies; with the new mask, all but the smallest inland waterbodies are masked.

We originally applied a 3 km buffer on coastlines and a 5 km buffer on the shorelines of inland waterbodies in the water mask dataset before using it to mask the interferograms, in an effort to reduce the chance that valid land pixels would be excluded from phase unwrapping. It appears, however, that the inclusion of more water pixels is more detrimental to phase unwrapping than the exclusion of some land pixels, so as of September 27, 2022, the water mask used for this option is no longer buffered.

Visit our [InSAR Water Masking Tutorial](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/485916be1b1d46889aa436794b5633cb "InSAR Water Masking StoryMap" ){target=_blank} for more information about how different water masking approaches can impact the quality of an interferogram.

### Post-Processing

#### Product Creation
Image files are exported into the widely-used GeoTIFF format in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone projection. Images
are resampled to a pixel size that reflects the resolution of output image based on the requested number of looks: 80 meters
for 20x4 looks, 40 meters for 10x2 looks, and 20 meters for 5x1 looks.

Supporting metadata files are created, as well as a quick-look browse image.

{% endblock %}

{% block packaging %}
## Product Packaging

The Burst InSAR output is a zip file containing various files including GeoTIFFs, a PNG browse image, a metadata file, and a README file.

### Naming Convention: INSAR_ISCE_BURST

The Burst InSAR product names are packed with information pertaining to the processing of the data, presented in the following order, as illustrated in Figure 3.

- The imaging platform name, always S1 for Sentinel-1.
- Relative burst ID values assigned by ESA. Each value identifies a consistent burst footprint; relative burst ID values differ from one sub-swath to the next.
- The imaging mode, currently only IW is supported.
- The swath number, either 1, 2, or 3, indicating which sub-swath the burst is located in.
- The acquisition dates of the reference (older) scene and the secondary (newer) scene.
- The polarizations for the pair, either HH or VV.
- The product type (always INT for InSAR) and the pixel spacing, which will be either 80, 40, or 20, based upon the number of looks selected when the job was submitted for processing.
- The filename ends with the ASF product ID, a 4 digit hexadecimal number.

### Naming Convention: INSAR_ISCE_MULTI_BURST

The naming scheme for products generated using the `INSAR_ISCE_MULTI_BURST` job type is very different from what was used for `INSAR_ISCE_BURST`.

The basename of the multi-burst InSAR files follows this naming convention: 

**S1s_rrr_lonl_f_lal_f_lonu_f_lau_f_yyyymmdd_yyyymmdd_pp_INTzz_cccc**

For example: 

S1A_064_E053_1_N27_3_E054_1_N27_8_20200604_20200616_VV_INT80_7EB5

The following table describes the individual components:

### Image Files

Most of the main InSAR product files are 32-bit floating-point single-band GeoTIFFs. The exceptions to this are the connected components and the water mask files, which are both 8-bit unsigned-integer single-band GeoTIFFs.

The following image files are geocoded to the appropriate UTM Zone map projection, based on the location of the output product:

- The *normalized coherence* file contains pixel values that range from 0.0 to 1.0, with 0.0 being completely non-coherent and 1.0 being perfectly coherent.
- The *unwrapped geocoded interferogram* file shows the results of the phase unwrapping process. Negative values indicate movement towards the sensor, and positive values indicate movement away from the sensor. This is the main interferogram output.
- The *wrapped geocoded interferogram* file indicates the interferogram phase after applying the adaptive filter immediately before unwrapping. Values range from negative pi to positive pi.
- The *connected components* file delineates regions unwrapped as contiguous units by the SNAPHU unwrapping algorithm.
- The *look vectors* theta (θ) and phi (φ) describe the elevation and orientation angles of the look vector in radians. The look vectors refer to the look direction back towards the sensor.
    - The *lv_theta* (θ) file indicates the SAR look vector elevation angle (in radians) at each pixel, ranging from -π/2 (down) to π/2 (up). The look vector elevation angle is defined as the angle between the horizontal surface and the look vector with positive angles indicating sensor positions above the surface.
    - The *lv_phi* (φ) file indicates the SAR look vector orientation angle (in radians) at each pixel. The look vector orientation angle is defined as the angle between the East direction and the projection of the look vector on the horizontal surface plane. The orientation angle increases towards north, with the North direction corresponding to π/2 (and south to -π/2). The orientation angle range is -π to π.
- The *DEM* file gives the local terrain heights in meters, with a geoid correction applied.
- The *water mask* file indicates coastal waters and large inland waterbodies. Pixel values of 1 indicate land and 0 indicate water. This file is in 8-bit unsigned integer format.

If the **water mask** option is selected, the water mask is applied prior to phase unwrapping to exclude water pixels from the process. The water mask is generated using the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about){target=_blank} and [ESA WorldCover](https://esa-worldcover.org/en/about/about){target=_blank} datasets. Refer to the [Water Masking Processing Option](#apply-water-mask) section and our [InSAR Water Masking Tutorial](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/485916be1b1d46889aa436794b5633cb "InSAR Water Masking StoryMap" ){target=_blank} for more information about water masking.

For jobs processed using `INSAR_ISCE_BURST`, there are also four non-geocoded images that remain in their native range-doppler coordinates. These four images comprise the image data required if users want to merge output Burst InSAR products together, and include:

- a *wrapped Range-Doppler interferogram*, which is a Range-Doppler version of the wrapped interferogram
- a two-band *Range-Doppler look vectors* image in the native ISCE2 format
- *Range-Doppler latitude coordinates* and *Range-Doppler longitude coordinates* images that provide the information necessary to map Range-Doppler images into the geocoded domain

These range-doppler files are not included in products generated using `INSAR_ISCE_MULTI_BURST`, 
as the individual bursts are already merged together.

An *unwrapped phase browse image* is included for the unwrapped (unw_phase) phase file, which is in PNG format and is 2048 pixels wide.

The tags and extensions used and example file names for each raster are listed in Table 2 below.

### Line-of-Sight Measurements
When looking at a single interferogram, the deformation measurements in the line-of-sight orientation of the sensor indicate relative motion towards or away from the sensor. InSAR is not sensitive to motion in the azimuth direction of the satellite, so motion that occurs in the same direction as the satellite's direction of travel will not be detected.

A single interferogram cannot be used to determine the relative contributions of vertical and horizontal movement to the line-of-sight displacement measurement. To determine how much of the signal is driven by vertical vs. horizontal movement, you must either use a time series of interferograms, or use reference measurements with known vertical and horizontal components (such as GNSS measurements from the region of deformation) to deconstruct the line-of-sight displacement.

### Phase Unwrapping Reference Point
The reference point for phase unwrapping is set automatically by the topsApp.py script. It may not be an ideal location to use as a reference point for phase unwrapping. If it is located in an area undergoing deformation, or in an area with low coherence, the unwrapping may be of lower quality than if the reference point was in a more suitable location.

Even when there are no phase unwrapping errors introduced by phase discontinuities, it is important to be aware that unwrapped phase differences are calculated relative to the reference point. The phase difference value of the reference point is set to 0 during phase unwrapping, so any displacement values will be relative to that benchmark.

If you are interested in the amount of displacement in a particular area, you may wish to choose your own reference point. The ideal reference point would be in an area of high coherence beyond where deformation has occurred. The unwrapped phase measurements can be adjusted to be relative to this new reference point. To adjust the values in the unwrapped phase GeoTIFF, simply select a reference point that is optimal for your use case and subtract the unwrapped phase value of that reference point from each pixel in the unwrapped phase raster:

**ΔΨ<sup>&ast;</sup>** = **ΔΨ** - Δψ<sub>ref</sub>

where **ΔΨ<sup>&ast;</sup>** is the adjusted unwrapped phase, **ΔΨ** is the original unwrapped phase, and Δψ<sub>ref</sub> is the unwrapped phase value at the new reference point.

#### Displacement Values from a Single Interferogram
In general, calculating displacement values from a single interferogram is not recommended. It will be more robust to use a time series approach to more accurately determine the pattern of movement. When using SAR time-series software such as [MintPy](https://mintpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "https://mintpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest" ){target=_blank}, you have the option to select a specific reference point, and the values of the input rasters will be adjusted accordingly.
