# Sentinel-1 GUNW Product Guide

This document is a guide for users of Sentinel-1 Geocoded Unwrapped (GUNW) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) products.  High-level GUNW interferograms are produced as a part of the [Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL)'s Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) Project](https://aria.jpl.nasa.gov/){target=_blank}. 
* Analysis ready products including an geocoded unwrapped interferogram
* ARIA-S1-GUNW is an official NASA product
* Initially developed as part of the Getting Ready for NISAR 
* Generated using JPL's TopsApp
  * ISCE2 InSAR workflow for S1 SLCs corresponding to a repeat-pass date
* Output L2 standard displacement product in netCDF format
  * 

### Acquiring products

#### Archive on Earthdata Search
* GUNW products are available on [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search){target=_blank} and [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/?dataset=SENTINEL-1%20INTERFEROGRAM%20(BETA)){target=_blank}
* Earthdata Search requires NASA Earthdata user login. (See ["What do I need to know about Earthdata login?"](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/documentation/what_do_i_need_to_know#:~:text=Simply%2C%20go%20to%20http%3A%2F%2F,of%20data%20user%20you%20are){target=_blank}
* Search the ARIA S1 Geocoded Unwrapped Interferograms collection
  * Can be refined with search parameters for date, etc
* If your desired GUNW does not exist, you can submit to HyP3

#### Submitting GUNWs using HyP3
* HyP3 accepts ARIA-S1-GUNW jobs
* required parameters are reference granules, secondary granules and a frame_id
* Interfaces to be further developed to aid in the search for appropriate frame_ids and granules on Vertex
* An example job would be ...


#### Frame IDs vs Granules
* In addition to reference and secondary scenes, a frame-id must be provided
* This is what makes the ARIA-S1-GUNW product "standard"
  * Done to ensure down-stream analysis is consistent and reproducible
* Restricts the resulting product to be within this frame
* geojson with S1 Frames is available in the [DockerizedTopsApp GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ACCESS-Cloud-Based-InSAR/DockerizedTopsApp/blob/dev/isce2_topsapp/data/s1_frames_latitude_aligned.geojson.zip){target=_blank}

### Output of standard product
L2 GUNW product 
All standard products have the following layers:

* Data Layers (0.00083333333 deg or ~90 m at the equator)
* Unwrapped phase
* Coherence
* Connected components
* Unfiltered coherence 
* InSAR amplitude
* Correction Layers
* Ionosphere (0.00916 deg or ~1 km at the equator) 
* Solid earth tide (.1 deg or ~11 km at the equator) 
* Tropospheric correction layers if HRRR available 
* Geometry Layers (.1 deg or ~11 km)
* Incidence angle
* Azimuth angle
* Parallel baseline
* Perpendicular baseline
* Lat/lon grids

### Algorithm
* Standard products are produced using [DockerizedTopsApp](https://github.com/ACCESS-Cloud-Based-InSAR/DockerizedTopsApp){target=_blank}
* Tropospheric corrections for RADAR are calculated using the [Raytracing Atmospheric Delay Estimation for RADAR (RAiDER)](https://github.com/dbekaert/RAiDER){target=_blank} package. 

#### Weather model
* built-in support for different weather models through RAiDER
* [High-resolution rapid refresh (HRRR)](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/){target=_blank} weather model generated by NOAA for continental US
* Available for continental US and Alaska
* Spatial resolution of about 3 km
* If there is no weather data available for AOI, no weather model will be applied

#### Metrics around Accuracy
