# OPERA RTC for Sentinel-1 (RTC-S1) Product Guide

This document is a guide for users of the 
[OPERA Radiometric Terrain Corrected Backscatter for Sentinel-1 (RTC-S1)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/rtc-product/ "www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/rtc-product" ){target=_blank} 
products. These products were developed by the 
[Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/ "www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera" ){target=_blank} 
project at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).

!!! tip "OPERA RTC-S1 Products Now Available On Demand"

    If OPERA RTC-S1 products are not available for your full time range or area of interest, you can now request 
    that they be generated using ASF's On Demand processing platform!


## OPERA RTC-S1 Products

OPERA's [Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Backscatter for Sentinel-1 (S1)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/rtc-product/ "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/rtc-product/" ){target=_blank} 
product consists of radar backscatter normalized with respect to topography. The RTC-S1 Level-2 products are projected 
into the appropriate UTM Zone or Polar Stereographic coordinate system for the location of each individual product, 
and provided in Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format.

The pixel values of the products represent gamma-0 power. The pixel spacing is 30 meters, and no speckle filter has 
been applied.

Radiometric Terrain Correction requires the use of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) both for 
[correcting distortions caused by topography](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/dc2807b444924fc3a76c117a2c909f8b#ref-n-uKhHbd "OPERA Sentinel-1 RTC StoryMap Tutorial" ){target=_blank}
and for geocoding the output product. The OPERA RTC-S1 products are processed using the 
[Copernicus GLO-30 DEM](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/copernicus-contributing-missions/collections-description/COP-DEM "Copernicus DEM" ){target=_blank}.

RTC products provide users with imagery of the earth's surface regardless of atmospheric conditions. This allows 
users to monitor surface processes during natural disasters, such as hurricanes or wildfires, or in areas that are 
prone to frequent cloud cover. Backscatter values can be used to determine surface water extent, soil moisture 
trends, surface roughness, and vegetation conditions. 

### Archived OPERA RTC-S1 Products

The OPERA project has generated RTC-S1 products for all Sentinel-1 acquisitions over landmasses (except Antarctica) 
since January 1, 2022. RTC-S1 products are output for all available polarizations. As new Sentinel-1 SLCs are 
acquired and added to ASF's archive, the OPERA project continues to process them to RTC-S1 products.  

RTC-S1 products generated by the OPERA project are all archived by ASF and can be accessed using a number of methods: 

  - ASF's [Vertex Data Search](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/?dataset=OPERA-S1&productTypes=RTC "search.asf.alaska.edu" ){target=_blank}, 
    which is a user-friendly and map-centric interface specialized for search and discover of ASF's SAR holdings
  - Programmatically using the [asf_search python package](https://docs.asf.alaska.edu/asf_search/basics/ "docs.asf.alaska.edu" ){target=_blank}
  - NASA's [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?p=C2777436413-ASF "search.earthdata.nasa.gov" ){target=_blank} 
    interface, which provides access to all of NASA's Earth Science datasets

For more information on options for accessing archived OPERA RTC-S1 products, refer to ASF's 
[OPERA Sentinel-1 RTC Tutorial](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/dc2807b444924fc3a76c117a2c909f8b "OPERA Sentinel-1 RTC StoryMap Tutorial" ){target=_blank}. 
For more information on the technical specifications of the OEPRA RTC-S1 products, refer to JPL's 
[RTC Product Documentation](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/rtc-product/ "OPERA RTC Product" ){target=_blank}.

### OPERA RTC-S1 Products On Demand

You can also order OPERA RTC-S1 products from ASF on demand. This is particularly useful if you need a time 
series of RTC-S1 products that extends beyond the start of the archive. On-Demand processing is available for any 
Sentinel-1 burst with the same burst ID (footprint) as an existing OPERA RTC-S1 product. 

On-Demand RTC-S1 products are generated using the same code that is used by the OPERA project, but are processed 
using ASF's 
[HyP3](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/){target=_blank} 
cloud-native processing platform instead of JPL's 
[OPERA SDS](https://software.nasa.gov/software/NPO-52101-1){target=_blank} 
processing management software. The products can be used interchangeably in a time series analysis.

## On-Demand RTC Products from ASF

In addition to OPERA RTC-S1 products, which use JPL's open-source 
[ISCE3 software](https://github.com/isce-framework/isce3 "github.com/isce-framework/isce3" ){target=_blank} 
to perform radiometric terrain correction, ASF also offers 
[On-Demand RTC products](rtc_product_guide.md "Sentinel-1 RTC Product Guide" ){target=_blank} 
generated using commercial [GAMMA](https://gamma-rs.ch/gamma-software "gamma-rs.ch/gamma-software" ){target=_blank} 
SAR processing software. 

These products are both high-quality Sentinel-1 RTC options, and you can use either with confidence for any given 
RTC-based analysis workflow. Because the products do use different algorithms for the RTC processing, however, 
a time-series analysis will be more consistent if you don't mix and match products generated using GAMMA and ISCE3. 

There are some key characteristics that differ between the two products, which may help you decide which would be 
most appropriate for your particular application. 

### Spatial Extent

OPERA RTC-S1 products are processed on the basis of an individual 
[radar burst](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/88c8fe67933340779eddef212d76b8b8 "Sentinel-1 Bursts StoryMap Tutorial" ){target=_blank} 
extracted from a Sentinel-1 
Interferometric Wide-Swath (IW) Single Look Complex (SLC) file, while ASF's RTC GAMMA On Demand products are 
generated using the Sentinel-1 Level 1 IW SLC or Ground Range Detected (GRD) file.

Advantages of burst-based products:

  - **RTC footprint is much smaller.** Each IW SLC contains many individual bursts (most often about 27), and you 
    may not need such extensive spatial coverage for your analysis. If you have a fairly small area of interest, 
    you can download and mosaic only the bursts you need.
  - **File sizes are smaller.** This is particularly important for users with limited internet access. Each OPERA 
    RTC-S1 GeoTIFF file is on the order of 8 MB, and you download each polarization separately. In contrast, ASF's 
    RTC GAMMA products are delivered as a zip file, which includes all available polarizations. These zip 
    files are generally upwards of 500 MB for products at 30-m pixel spacing, which can be challenging to download 
    successfully over slower connections.
  - **Footprints are consistent.** The individual Sentinel-1 bursts always have the same extent from one 
    acquisition to the next, which makes it very easy to generate time series over an area of interest. The framing of
    the full Sentinel-1 IW Level 1 products can shift over time, so there is no guarantee the acquisitions with the 
    same frame number will cover the same extent. This is particularly impactful when the area of interest is near 
    the top or bottom of the Sentinel-1 IW Level 1 scene.
