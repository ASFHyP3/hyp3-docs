# OPERA RTC for Sentinel-1 (RTC-S1) Product Guide

This document is a guide for users of the 
[OPERA Radiometric Terrain Corrected Backscatter for Sentinel-1 (RTC-S1)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/rtc-product/ "www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/rtc-product" ){target=_blank} 
products. These products were developed by the 
[Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/ "www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera" ){target=_blank} 
project at NASA's 
[Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/ "www.jpl.nasa.gov/" ){target=_blank} (JPL).

!!! tip "OPERA RTC-S1 Products Now Available On Demand"

    If OPERA RTC-S1 products are not available for your full time range or area of interest, you can now request 
    that they be generated using ASF's On Demand processing platform!


## OPERA RTC-S1 Products

OPERA's [Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Backscatter for Sentinel-1 (S1)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/rtc-product/ "https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/rtc-product/" ){target=_blank} 
product consists of radar backscatter normalized with respect to topography. The RTC-S1 Level-2 products are projected 
into the appropriate UTM Zone or Polar Stereographic coordinate system for the location of each individual product, 
and provided in 
[Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)](https://cogeo.org/ "https://cogeo.org/" ){target=_blank} 
format.

The pixel values of the products represent gamma-0 power. The pixel spacing is 30 meters, and no speckle filter has 
been applied.

RTC products provide users with imagery of the earth's surface regardless of atmospheric conditions. This allows 
users to monitor surface processes during natural disasters, such as hurricanes or wildfires, or in areas that are 
prone to frequent cloud cover. Backscatter values can be used to determine surface water extent, soil moisture 
trends, surface roughness, and vegetation conditions.

#### Digital Elevation Model (DEM)

Radiometric Terrain Correction requires the use of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) both for 
[correcting distortions caused by topography](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/dc2807b444924fc3a76c117a2c909f8b#ref-n-uKhHbd "OPERA Sentinel-1 RTC StoryMap Tutorial" ){target=_blank}
and for geocoding the output product. The OPERA RTC-S1 products are processed using the 
[Copernicus GLO-30 DEM](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/copernicus-contributing-missions/collections-description/COP-DEM "Copernicus DEM" ){target=_blank}.

#### Polarization

Most Sentinel-1 acquisitions are collected in two 
[polarizations](introduction_to_sar#polarizations), 
and the OPERA project generates RTC-S1 products for all available polarizations. Acquisitions over land generally 
have a vertical primary polarization, meaning that the SAR signal is sent out in a vertical orientation, but both 
the co-polarized returns (also vertically polarized) and the cross-polarized returns (horizontally polarized) are 
measured. This results in both VV and VH RTC-S1 products. 

In some areas, particularly remote islands and regions close to the Arctic Ocean, acquisitions are collected with a 
horizontal primary polarization. This results in HH and HV RTC-S1 products. 

Different polarizations are sensitive to different surface characteristics, with VV being more sensitive to surface 
roughness, VH or HV being more sensitive to volume scatterers such as vegetation, and HH being more sensitive to 
double-bounce scattering from objects that stand perpendicular to the ground. 

### Archived OPERA RTC-S1 Products

The OPERA project has generated RTC-S1 products for all Sentinel-1 acquisitions over landmasses (except Antarctica) 
since January 1, 2022. RTC-S1 products are output for all available polarizations. As new Sentinel-1 SLCs are 
acquired and added to ASF's archive, the OPERA project continues to process them to RTC-S1 products.  

RTC-S1 products generated by the OPERA project are all archived by ASF and can be accessed using a number of methods: 

  - ASF's [Vertex Data Search](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/?dataset=OPERA-S1&productTypes=RTC "search.asf.alaska.edu" ){target=_blank}, 
    which is a user-friendly and map-centric interface specialized for search and discover of ASF's SAR holdings
  - Programmatically using the [asf_search Python package](https://docs.asf.alaska.edu/asf_search/basics/ "docs.asf.alaska.edu" ){target=_blank}
  - NASA's [Earthdata Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?p=C2777436413-ASF "search.earthdata.nasa.gov" ){target=_blank} 
    interface, which provides access to all of NASA's Earth Science datasets

For more information on options for accessing archived OPERA RTC-S1 products, refer to ASF's 
[OPERA Sentinel-1 RTC Tutorial](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/dc2807b444924fc3a76c117a2c909f8b "OPERA Sentinel-1 RTC StoryMap Tutorial" ){target=_blank}. 
For more information on the technical specifications of the OPERA RTC-S1 products, refer to JPL's 
[RTC Product Documentation](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/rtc-product/ "OPERA RTC Product" ){target=_blank}.

### OPERA RTC-S1 Products On Demand

You can also order OPERA RTC-S1 products from ASF on demand. This is particularly useful if you need a time 
series of RTC-S1 products that extends beyond the start of the archive. On-Demand processing is available for any 
Sentinel-1 burst with the same burst ID (footprint) as an existing OPERA RTC-S1 product. 

On-Demand RTC-S1 products are generated using the same code that is used by the OPERA project, but are processed 
using ASF's 
[HyP3](https://hyp3-docs.asf.alaska.edu/){target=_blank} 
cloud-native processing platform instead of JPL's 
[OPERA Science Data System (SDS)](https://software.nasa.gov/software/NPO-52101-1){target=_blank} 
processing management software. 

Archived and On-Demand RTC-S1 products can be used interchangeably in a time series analysis.

## On-Demand RTC Products from ASF

In addition to OPERA RTC-S1 products, which use JPL's open-source 
[ISCE3 software](https://github.com/isce-framework/isce3 "github.com/isce-framework/isce3" ){target=_blank} 
to perform radiometric terrain correction, ASF also offers 
[On-Demand RTC products](rtc_product_guide.md "Sentinel-1 RTC Product Guide" ){target=_blank} 
generated using commercial [GAMMA](https://gamma-rs.ch/gamma-software "gamma-rs.ch/gamma-software" ){target=_blank} 
SAR processing software. 

These products are both high-quality Sentinel-1 RTC options, and you can use either with confidence for any given 
RTC-based analysis workflow. Because the products do use different algorithms for the RTC processing, however, 
a time-series analysis will be more consistent if you don't mix and match products generated using GAMMA and ISCE3. 

There are some key characteristics that differ between the two products, which may help you decide which would be 
most appropriate for your particular application. 

### Spatial Extent

OPERA RTC-S1 products are processed on the basis of an individual 
[radar burst](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/88c8fe67933340779eddef212d76b8b8 "Sentinel-1 Bursts StoryMap Tutorial" ){target=_blank} 
extracted from a Sentinel-1 
Interferometric Wide-Swath (IW) Single Look Complex (SLC) file, while ASF's RTC GAMMA On Demand products are 
generated using the Sentinel-1 Level 1 IW SLC or Ground Range Detected (GRD) file.

Advantages of burst-based products:

  - **RTC footprint is much smaller.** Each IW SLC contains many individual bursts (most often about 27), and you 
    may not need such extensive spatial coverage for your analysis. If you have a fairly small area of interest, 
    you can download and mosaic only the bursts you need.
  - **File sizes are smaller.** This is particularly important for users with limited internet access. Each OPERA 
    RTC-S1 GeoTIFF file is on the order of 8 MB, and you download each polarization separately. In contrast, ASF's 
    RTC GAMMA products are delivered as a zip file, which includes all available polarizations. These zip 
    files are generally upwards of 500 MB for products at 30-m pixel spacing, which can be challenging to download 
    successfully over slower connections.
  - **Footprints are consistent.** The individual Sentinel-1 bursts always have the same extent from one 
    acquisition to the next, which makes it very easy to generate time series over an area of interest. The framing of
    the full Sentinel-1 IW Level 1 products can shift over time, so there is no guarantee the acquisitions with the 
    same frame number will cover the same extent. This is particularly impactful when the area of interest is near 
    the top or bottom of the Sentinel-1 IW Level 1 scene.

If your area of interest is large, and is well-covered by a full Sentinel-1 IW scene (or requires several full 
scenes to cover the entire area), you may find it easier to work with the full-scene RTC GAMMA products, as there 
would be fewer individual files to manage. 

### Processing Options

**On-Demand processing of OPERA RTC-S1 products is currently confined to the default settings of the archived 
products.** OPERA RTC-S1 products are output in gamma-0 power with 30-m pixel spacing. While we expect to offer 
some customization options in the future, the only method currently available for ordering products with a different 
radiometry, scale, or pixel spacing is to order ASF's [On-Demand Sentinel-1 RTC products](rtc_product_guide.md) 
processed using GAMMA software. 

Learn more about the options available for processing full-scene Sentinel-1 RTC GAMMA products and why you might 
find them useful in the 
[Processing Options section](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/2ead3222d2294d1fae1d11d3f98d7c35#ref-n-ycU3H8){target=_blank}

[RTC On Demand! tutorial](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/2ead3222d2294d1fae1d11d3f98d7c35 "RTC On Demand!" ){target=_blank}. 

### RGB Decomposition

It can be helpful to combine co-polarized and cross-polarized RTC values into a false-color image. There are a 
number of methods for combining VV and VH or HH and HV into the red, green, and blue channels, which is commonly 
called RGB Decomposition. 

The RGB Decomposition approach used by the OPERA team for the RTC-S1 products is very different from the approach 
ASF uses for the Sentinel-1 RTC On Demand products processed using GAMMA.

#### OPERA RTC-S1 RGB Decomposition

The OPERA project uses a simple approach to combining polarizations to generate a color browse image, which is 
displayed in Vertex when you search for OPERA RTC-S1 products. This RGB Decomposition assigns co-pol values
(VV or HH) to both the red and blue bands, the co-pol values (VH or HV) to the green band, and applies a scalar to 
balance the color range. 

In these color images, water generally appears black, areas with vegetation appear more green, and other areas 
appear pink.

You can download these browse images from the Vertex interface by selecting an RTC-S1 product from the list of 
search results, and clicking the download icon above the image preview in the center panel, as shown in Figure 1. 
Note that these browse images are not georeferenced, though you can use the individual RTC GeoTIFFs as a 
reference for manually georeferencing the browse images. 

![Figure 1](../images/opera-browse-download.png "Interface for downloading an OPERA RTC-S1 RGB Decomposition")

This approach is also used to generate the imagery tiles for OPERA RTC-S1 that will be displayed in NASA's 
[Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/ "worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/" ){target=_blank}
platform. 

You can also create your own OPERA RTC-S1 RGB Decompositions using GIS software. 
  - In ArcGIS, use the 
    [Composite Bands geoprocessing tool](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/data-management/composite-bands.htm){target=_blank} 
    or 
    [raster function template](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/raster-functions/composite-bands-function.htm){target=_blank} 
    to assign the VV and VH layers to the desired color channels. 
  - In QGIS, use the 
    [Build Virtual Raster](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/training_manual/rasters/data_manipulation.html){target=_blank} 
    algorithm. 

#### RTC GAMMA RGB Decomposition

The Sentinel-1 RTC On Demand products processed using GAMMA software include a georeferenced RGB Decomposition 
browse image in the product package. You also have the 
[option to include a full-resolution RGB Decomposition GeoTIFF](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/2ead3222d2294d1fae1d11d3f98d7c35#ref-n-AYvRBH "RGB Decomposition Option" ){target=_blank}  
in the output package when submitting the RTC job for processing. 

The algorithm used to generate the RGB Decomposition images included in the product package is very different from 
the approach used by the OPERA team. It uses a series of thresholds to determine which values to attribute to the 
different color bands. Pixels with very low values in both the co- and cross-pol RTC products are assigned to the 
blue channel. Pixels with high cross-pol values are assigned to the green channel. Pixels with high co-pol values but 
low cross-pol values are assigned to the red channel. 

In these images, water generally appears blue, vegetated areas look green, and other regions (urban areas, agricultural 
fields, sparsely vegetated areas) are yellow or orange. 

A full description of the approach ASF uses for generating RGB Decomposition products is available 
[here](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-lib/blob/main/docs/rgb_decomposition.md){target=_blank}.

If you want to generate a full-resolution RGB image from an RTC GAMMA product but neglected to select the option 
to include it in the product package, you can also use the RGB Decomposition Tool in 
[ASF's ArcGIS Toolbox](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/tools/asf-arcgis-toolbox){target=_blank}.

## Sentinel-1 Mission

The [Sentinel-1 mission](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1 "https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1" ){target=_blank} 
collects C-band band SAR from a pair of polar-orbiting satellites launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) 
as part of the 
[Copernicus program](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/The_Sentinel_missions "https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/The_Sentinel_missions" ){target=_blank}. 
The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched April 3, 2014, Sentinel-1B was launched April 25, 2016, and Sentinel-1C was 
launched December 5, 2024. 

Sentinel-1A is still collecting data, but 
[Sentinel-1B ended its mission](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1/Mission_ends_for_Copernicus_Sentinel-1B_satellite "https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1/Mission_ends_for_Copernicus_Sentinel-1B_satellite" ){target=_blank} on December 23, 2021. 

Sentinel-1C is now in position to replace Sentinel-1B in the constellation, returning the Sentinel-1 mission to full 
observation capacity. 

The two Sentinel-1 satellites each have a 12-day repeat cycle, but their orbits are offset 180 degrees so that one 
or the other will pass over the same location on earth every 6 days. When two S1 satellites are in orbit, Europe 
and select areas of interest are imaged with a 6-day interval, as described in the 
[mission observation scenario](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/copernicus/sentinel-1/observation-scenario "https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/copernicus/sentinel-1/observation-scenario" ){target=_blank}, 
while most landmasses are imaged on a 12-day repeat cycle.

For the time period between when Sentinel-1B stopped acquiring data and before Sentinel-1C started acquiring data, 
coverage was more sparse. Some areas did not have any imagery acquired between December 2021 and April 2025. 
Depending on your area of interest, you may have limited data available during that time. 

Because this is a polar-orbiting satellite constellation, areas near the poles may have overlapping orbits, 
resulting in more frequent acquisitions than indicated by the observation scenario.
