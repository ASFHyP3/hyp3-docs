# Introducing HyP3+! <br> A new, sustainable HyP3 deployment

ASF's on-demand processing service, HyP3, has created more than 11 million analysis-ready Sentinel-1 products since its public debut in October 2020. Five years later, our output has grown to around half a million products a month for more than 1,000 users. 

This free service is currently made possible through generous funding from NASA.

To ensure this service is accessible to the entire community, we have created a credit system and implemented a round-robin processing queue. The current monthly allocation of 10,000 credits per user has served the majority of our users well, but we regularly receive requests for credit increases. We’re happy to grant them when our budget allows!

Growing uncertainty around federal funding and the continued growth of on-demand processing needs could soon leave us unable to meet the needs of our user community with our existing HyP3 service. 

To support on-demand processing going forward, we are piloting **HyP3+**, a user-sustained deployment of HyP3 available to the public with the ability to purchase processing credits using a credit card. It works just like our basic HyP3 service support by NASA, but you are not constrained by monthly credit allotments, and output products are retained for 30 days instead of 14. For a full feature comparison, see: Table below

Our on-demand processing platform has become a core component of ASF’s [mission](https://asf.alaska.edu/about-asf/) to make remote-sensing data accessible, so we are pricing our HyP3+ credits to just cover our costs. Any surplus will be reinvested into our user community and our mission. 

Importantly, **we remain steadfastly committed to continuing our free on-demand processing service** as long as it’s funded, and we will continue to fulfill credit increase requests as long as our budget allows. 

We are providing HyP3+ simply as an option if your allotment of free credits is insufficient for your processing needs.
