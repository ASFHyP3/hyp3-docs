# Sentinel-1 Mission

The Sentinel-1 satellite constellation is part of the Copernicus Earth Observation program, coordinated by the European Space Agency (ESA) on behalf of the European Commission (EC). Sentinel-1 satellites carry C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instruments for global, around-the-clock imagery acquisition, even through cloud cover. 

More information about the mission is available from the [European Space Agency Sentinel-1 Mission website](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/s1-mission "Sentinel-1 Mission" ){target=_blank}.

## The Sentinel-1 Constellation

The Sentinel-1 mission was designed to be a two-satellite constellation, though there have been periods when 
only one satellite has been available for image acquisition.

- Sentinel-1A was launched April 3, 2014, and is still actively acquiring imagery. 
- Sentinel-1B  was launched April 25, 2016, but [ended its mission](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1/Mission_ends_for_Copernicus_Sentinel-1B_satellite "https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1/Mission_ends_for_Copernicus_Sentinel-1B_satellite" ){target=_blank} on December 23, 2021.
- Sentinel-1C was launched December 5, 2024, replacing Sentinel-1B in the constellation, and 
  [has been acquiring imagery regularly since March 26, 2025](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/news/2025-3-25-sentinel-1c-user-data-opening-26th-march "https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/news/2025-3-25-sentinel-1c-user-data-opening-26th-march" ){target=_blank}.

Each Sentinel-1 satellite has a 12-day repeat cycle, and they all use the same orbit pattern. When there are two active 
sensors in the constellation, their orbits are offset 180 degrees to allow repeat passes every 6 days. In this 
scenario, most global landmasses are imaged every 12 days. However, some areas of particular interest to the EC, 
including Europe and areas undergoing rapid changes due to uplift or subsidence activity, are imaged every 6 days.

[Sentinel-1's Acquisition Plans](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/copernicus/sentinel-1/acquisition-plans "https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/copernicus/sentinel-1/acquisition-plans" ){target=_blank} 
for more information on the acquisition plans that have been used by the mission through time.

## Transition from Sentinel-1B to Sentinel-1C

As of December 23, 2021, Sentinel-1B was no longer able to acquire data. An anomaly related to the power supply 
could not be repaired, and the satellite has been decommissioned. Refer to 
[ESA's documentation of the end of the Sentinel-1B mission](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1/Mission_ends_for_Copernicus_Sentinel-1B_satellite "Mission Ends for Copernicus Sentinel-1B Satellite" ){target=_blank} 
for more information.

The loss of Sentinel-1B resulted in a significant reduction in the spatial and temporal coverage of the Sentinel-1 
mission. Refer to 
[this article by Iain Woodhouse](https://www.earthblox.io/blog/the-impact-of-the-sentinel-1b-failure-and-looking-forward-to-sentinel-1c "The impact of the Sentinel-1B failure and looking forward to Sentinel-1C" ){target=_blank} 
for an illustration of the global impact of the Sentinel-1B failure. The image below illustrates a gap in the 
acquisitions over Alaska. This area of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta did not have a Sentinel-1 acquisition during 
the summer of 2022 until August 15.

The gaps in coverage were particularly noticeable the first few months after Sentinel-1B lost power, but some areas 
continued to have little or no coverage in the period from December 2021 to April 2025, when Sentinel-1C began 
acquiring data regularly. Keep this in mind as you search for data in your area of interest. If there are fewer 
results than you would expect, you can

## The Future of the Sentinel-1 Mission

Now that Sentinel-1C has replaced Sentinel-1B, and Sentinel-1A continues to acquire data, the constellation has 
returned to the same observation scenario used when both Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B were active. The 
Sentinel-1A platform is approaching the end of its mission, however, and 
[plans are underway to launch Sentinel-1D to replace it](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1/Ariane_6_to_take_Sentinel-1D_into_orbit ){target=_blank.
