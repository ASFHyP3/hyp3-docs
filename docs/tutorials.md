# HyP3 Tutorials

## Jupyter Notebooks

We provide step-by-step tutorials for using HyP3 programmatically via Jupyter Notebooks. 

* [Using the HyP3 Python SDK](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/blob/main/docs/sdk_example.ipynb "Using the HyP3 SDK Tutorial" ){target=_blank}
  -- This notebook walks through ordering and accessing RTC, InSAR, and autoRIFT products in Python using the HyP3 SDK.
* [Using the HyP3 SDK to search for jobs run by another user](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/blob/main/docs/search_other_user_jobs.ipynb "Using the HyP3 SDK to search for jobs run by another user" ){target=_blank}
  -- This notebook walks through using the HyP3 SDK to search for jobs run by another user.
* [Using the HyP3 SDK to update a job name](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-sdk/blob/main/docs/hyp3_job_name_change.ipynb "Using the HyP3 SDK to update a job name"){target=_blank}
  -- This notebook walks through using the HyP3 SDK to rename one of your previously submitted jobs. 
* [Using the HyP3 SDK to process new granules for given search parameters](./tutorials/process-new-granules-for-search-parameters.md)
  -- These notebooks demonstrate how to process new granules that match particular search parameters,
     which is particularly useful for ongoing monitoring of a geographic area of interest.
* [Time series analysis with HyP3 and MintPy](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-docs/blob/main/docs/tutorials/hyp3_insar_stack_for_ts_analysis.ipynb "Time series analysis with HyP3 and MintPy Tutorial" ){target=_blank}
  -- This notebook walks through performing a time-series analysis of the 2019 
  Ridgecrest, CA earthquake with HyP3 On Demand InSAR products and MintPy.
* [Time series analysis with HyP3 ISCE2 burst InSAR products and MintPy](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-docs/blob/main/docs/tutorials/hyp3_isce2_burst_stack_for_ts_analysis.ipynb "Time series analysis with HyP3 ISCE2 burst InSAR products and MintPy Tutorial" ){target=_blank}
  -- This notebook walks through performing a time-series analysis of the 2019 
  Ridgecrest, CA earthquake with HyP3 On Demand Burst InSAR products and MintPy.
* [Merging of burst InSAR products with HyP3 ISCE2](https://github.com/ASFHyP3/hyp3-docs/blob/develop/docs/tutorials/hyp3_isce2_burst_merge.ipynb "Merging of burst InSAR products with HyP3 ISCE2 Tutorial" ){target=_blank}
  -- This notebook walks through merging a pair of burst InSAR products with HyP3 ISCE2, using the deformation signal related to a 2020 Iranian earthquake as an example.


## StoryMaps

ASF provides a variety of interactive StoryMap tutorials focused on accessing and using
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data available from ASF. They can all be accessed here:
