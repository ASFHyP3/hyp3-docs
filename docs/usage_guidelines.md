# Product Usage Guidelines

When using this data in a publication or presentation, we ask that you include the
acknowledgement provided with each product. DOIs are also provided for citation
when discussing the HyP3 software or plugins.

- For multi-file products, the acknowledgement and relevant DOIs are included in
  the `*.README.md.txt` file.
- For netCDF products, the acknowledgement is included in the `source` global attribute
  and the DOIs are included in the `references` global attribute.
