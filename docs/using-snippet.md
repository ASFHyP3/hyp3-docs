On Demand products processed by HyP3 can be requested quickly and easily, either by
using a web interface or programmatically. These services are currently only available for [Sentinel-1 datasets](sentinel1.md "Sentinel-1 Mission" ){target=_blank}.

Different HyP3 job types consume different credit amounts. In HyP3 Basic, users are allotted 10,000 credits per month for free. Refer to the
[Credits page](using/credits.md "Jump to the Credits documentation page") 
for more information. 

If you do not have enough credits to generate all the products you need for your 
project, you can purchase additional credits in [HyP3+](about/hyp3_plus.md).

tools for selecting pairs and stacks for InSAR analysis.
