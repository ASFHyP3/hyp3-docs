# Paid Processing

For users who need to process more On Demand products than their 
[credit limit](credits.md "Jump to the Credits page of the documentation") 
allows, ASF supports a HyP3 deployment where users can pay for additional processing. 

The same 
[products](../products.md "Jump to the Products landing page of the documentation") are available, and users 
access their additional credit limit by logging in with the same 
[Earthdata Login Credentials](authentication.md#earthdata-login-edl) used for ordering 
free On Demand products, but a different API endpoint is used to submit jobs using purchased credits.
