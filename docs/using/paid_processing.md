# Paid Processing

For users who need to process more On Demand products than their 
[credit limit](credits.md "Jump to the Credits page of the documentation") 
allows, ASF supports a HyP3 deployment where users can pay for additional processing. 

The same 
[products](../products.md "Jump to the Products landing page of the documentation") are available, and users 
access their additional credit limit by logging in with the same 
[Earthdata Login Credentials](authentication.md#earthdata-login-edl) used for ordering 
free On Demand products, but a different API endpoint is used to submit jobs using purchased credits. 

## Purchasing Credits

Credits can be purchased at 
[ASF's Web Store](https://epay.alaska.edu/C21563_ustores/web/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCTID=7530&SINGLESTORE=true "https://epay.alaska.edu" ){target=_blank}. Credit purchases will be processed within two business days, and purchased credits do not expire.

1. Select the quantity of credits you need, and click the **Add to Cart** button. Refer to the 
[credit cost table](credits.md#credit-cost-table) to calculate the number of credits you will need to process the 
products you require.

2. Enter your Earthdata Login (EDL) username, then click the **Continue** button. It is very important to enter your 
username correctly, as the credits you purchase will be associated with this username. 

3. You can add credits linked to multiple EDL usernames to the same cart. To add additional credits linked to a 
different username, simply click the **Continue Shopping** button, and add another amount of credits to your cart. 
You will again be prompted for an EDL username, and you can enter the other username. 

4. When you are ready to check out, click the **Checkout** button. You do not need to Login on the Checkout page. 
Enter your email in the *Contact Information* section, and click the **Checkout as Guest** button. It is very 
important to enter an email address at which you can be reached, as this will be used to send the confirmation 
emails indicating when the order was received and processed, and if there are any issues that need to be resolved.

5. Enter your payment information, and click the **Continue** button to access the order confirmation and recipt pages.

### Order Confirmation

An email is sent when your order is successfully submitted. It includes the details about your purchase, including the 
EDL username(s) to which the credits will be assigned. If you notice any errors, send an email to 
uso@asf.alaska.edu describing the issue. 

### Order Completion

Once we receive your order, we will add the number of purchased credits to the specified username(s). ***This process 
will be completed within two business days of the order confirmation.*** You will receive an email confirming that the 
credits have been assigned to your username, at which point they are available for use.

Credits do not expire. 

### Refunds

If you purchase credits in error, need to assign purchased credits to a different username, or if you end up not 
needing all of your purchased credits, send an email to uso@asf.alaska.edu and we will work with you to resolve 
the issue.
