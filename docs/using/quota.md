# Monthly Processing Quota

!!! attention
    Due to the increasing popularity of On Demand processing, and in order to
    continue providing this service at no cost to users, **beginning February 2022,
    processing quotas will be set to 1000 jobs per user per month.**

    If this change impacts your current workflows, or doesn't meet your needs,
    please let us know!


In order to provide On Demand products across the community, and to support our mission of
[making remote-sensing data accessible](https://asf.alaska.edu/about-asf/),
we've implemented a monthly processing quota. Anyone with an [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home)
can freely request 1000 jobs each calendar month.

We may periodically adjust this quota based on usage, with the goal of
providing valuable products to the widest breadth of users possible.

If the quota doesn't meet your needs, please contact us and let us know how you
would like to use the service. We have several options available for increased
processing via HyP3. All requests will be balanced against our mission -- to make
remote-sensing data accessible to the community.
