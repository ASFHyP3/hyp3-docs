# User Quota

!!! attention
    Due to the incredible popularity of On Demand processing, and in order to
    continue providing this service for free, **beginning October 2021, user quotas
    will be 250 jobs per month.**

    If this change impacts your current workflows, or doesn't meet your needs,
    please let us know!


In order to provide On Demand products to a wide breadth of users and continue
[making remote-sensing data accessible](https://asf.alaska.edu/about-asf/),
we've implemented a monthly user quota. Anyone with an [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home)
can freely request 250 jobs each month, and the quota will reset each month.

We may periodically adjust this quota based on user behavior with the goal of
providing this service to the widest breadth of users possible.

If the quota doesn't meet your needs, please contact us and let us know how you
would like to use the service, including a description of your project. We have
several options available for increased processing via HyP3. All requests will
be balanced against our mission -- to make remote-sensing data accessible
to the community.
