# Monthly Processing Quota

!!! warning "Attention"
    Beginning **April 1st**, ASF On Demand's Monthly Processing Quota
    will be replaced by a new **credits system**.
    Read the full announcement [here](/credits).


In order to provide On Demand products across the community, and to support our mission of
[making remote-sensing data accessible](https://asf.alaska.edu/about-asf/ "https://asf.alaska.edu/about-asf/" ){target=_blank},
we've implemented a monthly processing quota. Anyone with an [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home "https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home" ){target=_blank}
can freely request 1000 jobs each calendar month.

We may periodically adjust this quota based on usage, with the goal of
providing valuable products to the widest breadth of users possible.

If the quota doesn't meet your needs, please contact us and let us know how you
would like to use the service. We have several options available for increased
processing via HyP3. All requests will be balanced against our mission -- to make
remote-sensing data accessible to the community.
