# Requesting Access

Before a new user can submit jobs for On Demand processing using the HyP3 platform, they must request access. **Users can only register one HyP3 account per person.**

!!! tip "Existing HyP3 users do not need to request access" 

    Existing On Demand users will *not* need to undergo this process unless they have been identified as having multiple HyP3 accounts. If you are an existing user who is no longer able to process On Demand jobs, you can either submit an [access request form](#TODO: add link to request form) or email uso@asf.alaska.edu for more information.

To request access, simply fill out the [Access Request Form](#TODO: add link to request form). You will need to have valid [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/ 'https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/' ){target=_blank} (EDL) credentials to complete this request. If you do not already have EDL credentials, you can [register here](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new 'https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new' ){target=_blank}. 

Your request will be processed within 48 hours (#TODO: adjust this limit as necessary), and you will receive an email with your approval status. If you have not already registered for HyP3 access, you can expect to be approved.

Once your access request has been approved, you can submit jobs for On Demand processing using your EDL credentials. *You only need to complete this approval process once.* 

If your request is denied, and you do not already have a HyP3 account, email uso@asf.alaska.edu to let us know that you believe you have been denied in error.
