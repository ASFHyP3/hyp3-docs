# Requesting Access

<!-- TODO TOOL-2787: update this language after the feature has been released -->
Starting on **June 17, 2024**, new users will be required to request access
before submitting jobs for On Demand processing using the HyP3 platform.
HyP3 accounts are limited to one per person.
If you have used HyP3 for On Demand processing in the past, you will be able to continue using our service without requesting access.

<!-- TODO TOOL-2787: uncomment the following line and add button link: -->
<!-- [Request Access](#){ .md-button .md-button--primary .middle } -->

You will need an [Earthdata Login](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/ 'https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/' ){target=_blank} 
(EDL) account before requesting access.
You can [register here](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new 'https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new' ){target=_blank}
if you do not already have an account.

After submitting your request, you will receive an email with your approval status within **two business days.**
You can expect to be approved if you have not already registered for HyP3 access
using a different Earthdata Login account.

Once your access request has been approved, you can submit jobs for On Demand processing using your EDL credentials. 
*You only need to complete this approval process once.* 

!!! tip "Existing HyP3 users do not need to request access" 

    Existing On Demand users (i.e. users who signed up before June 17, 2024) do *not* need to undergo this process.
    If you are no longer able to process On Demand jobs and you believe you should still have access, you can either 
    submit an access request or email [uso@asf.alaska.edu](mailto:uso@asf.alaska.edu "uso@asf.alaska.edu") for more information.

## Workshops and Tutorials

If you are leading a workshop or tutorial and your participants will require access to HyP3, 
we can provide you with a unique access code to streamline the access request process. Your participants can enter 
this code in the access request form to receive immediate, automatic approval.

If you would like to request a unique access code, please email 
[uso@asf.alaska.edu](mailto:uso@asf.alaska.edu "uso@asf.alaska.edu") with a description of your workshop or tutorial.
