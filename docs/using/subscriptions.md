# Subscriptions in HyP3

The Subscriptions feature of the HyP3 service
(known as On Demand within [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/))
has been deprecated in favor of a more flexible approach.
The On Demand service itself will continue to operate normally.
If you have never used the Subscriptions feature, then you can ignore this announcement.

You can follow [these tutorials](../tutorials/process-new-granules-for-search-parameters.md)
to achieve subscription-like functionality using Jupyter notebooks.

!!! warning
    The Subscriptions feature has been deprecated and will be **removed** as early as **Tuesday, September 5.**
    Please read this page carefully and take the recommended actions to avoid data loss.

All **subscription metadata** (job type, start and end date, area of interest, etc.)
will be **deleted** when the Subscriptions feature is removed.
Before **Tuesday, September 5,** please use either of the following methods
to save any subscription metadata that is important to you:

* If you only want to save a few metadata items from your subscriptions,
  you can visit [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/), ASF's Data Search web portal.
  Click the "On Demand" button and select "Subscriptions" from the drop-down menu.
  You should see a list of your subscriptions.
  Click the arrow next to each subscription to expand the subscription.
  Then copy any metadata fields that are important to you.
  To copy the area of interest, click the icon next to the "Search Area" field.
* If you want to save a large amount of your subscription metadata,
  first sign in to [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/) using your Earthdata credentials.
  Then visit the HyP3 API's `GET /subscriptions` endpoint
  [here](https://hyp3-api.asf.alaska.edu/ui/#/default/get_subscriptions).
  Click "Try it out", edit the query parameters, and click "Execute".
  (Select blank values for all the parameters if you wish to retrieve metadata for all of your subscriptions.)
  Download the JSON response to your computer.
  Review the metadata to confirm that it contains the information you expect.

Note that On Demand products generated by your subscriptions
will not be deleted when the Subscriptions feature is removed,
but the product download links will still expire after 14 days, as usual.

Please [contact us](../contact.md) if you have questions regarding this decision
or if you need help saving your subscription metadata.
