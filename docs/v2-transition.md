# Welcome to HyP3 v2

As of September 30, 2021, our beta HyP3 service available at <https://hyp3.asf.alaska.edu/>
has been retired in favor of our new On Demand service powered by HyP3 version 2 (hereafter, just "HyP3").

On Demand processing through HyP3 is now available directly in [Vertex](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/ "https://search.asf.alaska.edu" ){target=_blank},
ASF's data search portal. Vertex provides a friendly interface to request 
processing jobs and review previous jobs. To learn how to request jobs through Vertex, please consult the following resources:
