HyP3 SDK v1.7.4### Changed
* `hyp3-sdk` now uses a `src` layout per this [recommendation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/).
* `hyp3-sdk` now only uses `pyproject.toml` for package creation now that `setuptools` recommends [not using setup.py](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html#setuppy-discouraged).
* `hyp3_sdk.util` is now included in the main `hyp3_sdk` API and does not need to be imported separately
